# DATATYPES IN PYTHON
In python we use mainly 3 DATATYPES:

->int -Int datatype has only  whole number for example 1,2,3.

->float -float datatype are any  number including the decimal value for example 1.124,1.00,5.124.

->string -Anything in between the colan is called a string. for example 'sainath','sainath1234'.


# Variables in python

* Variables saved on temporary memory(RAM) not in perminant memory

* int and float datatypes occupies 4 bytes of memory.

* string datatype occupies 1 bytes for each character and space in between the string is also a character.for  example 'python' is a string which has 6 characters and each character holds the 1 byte memory.
* we can find the address of an variable by using the id(variable) function.
* we can find a type of a variable by using the type(a) function.


# Rules to create a variable
* variable should not start with a number if you want to use number as a variable use underscore(_) in starting.
* variable should be a single word or a character if you want to use multiple words use (_) in between them.
* python variables are completly case sensitive.
* dont use the below punctuations as a variable like !,@,#,$,%,<,>,&,*,(,),-.
